----- Machine Learning Model Comparison Tool -----

This is a streamlit application for comparing linear regression, random forest, and neural network models. 
It compares the performance of these models when tasked with predicting housing prices using their qualities.

To run the app:
1. Clone the repository
2. Create a virtual environment with python -m venv streamlit-env
3. Activate it with streamlit-env\Scripts\activate
4. Install dependencies with pip install -r requirements.txt
5. Run the app with streamlit run main.py


NOTE: Tensorflow is not yet compatible with Python 3.12 and up. If you are using a newer version, you can remove
tensorflow from the requirements and test without neural network.
